Upon receiving a\n                <code>SplitShard</code> request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns a response\n            and sets the stream status to <code>UPDATING</code>. After the operation is completed,\n            Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to <code>ACTIVE</code>. Read and write\n            operations continue to work while the stream is in the <code>UPDATING</code> state. </p>\n        <p>You can use <code>DescribeStream</code> to check the status of the stream, which is\n            returned in <code>StreamStatus</code>. If the stream is in the <code>ACTIVE</code>\n            state, you can call <code>SplitShard</code>. If a stream is in <code>CREATING</code> or\n                <code>UPDATING</code> or <code>DELETING</code> states, <code>DescribeStream</code>\n            returns a <code>ResourceInUseException</code>.</p>\n        <p>If the specified stream does not exist, <code>DescribeStream</code> returns a\n                <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code>. If you try to create more shards than are\n            authorized for your account, you receive a <code>LimitExceededException</code>. </p>\n        <p>For the default shard limit for an AWS account, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html\">Kinesis Data Streams\n                Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer\n                Guide</i>.

Each record in the request can be as large as 1 MB, up to a limit of 5 MB for the entire request, including partition keys. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MB per second.</p>\n        <p>You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data;\n            and an array of request <code>Records</code>, with each record in the array requiring a\n            partition key and data blob. The record size limit applies to the total size of the\n            partition key and data blob.</p>\n        <p>The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so on.</p>\n        <p>The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams as input to a hash function that\n            maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. An MD5 hash function is\n            used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records\n            to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the same\n            partition key map to the same shard within the stream.

The\n            response <code>Records</code> array always includes the same number of records as the\n            request array.</p>\n        <p>The response <code>Records</code> array includes both successfully and\n            unsuccessfully processed records. Kinesis Data Streams attempts to process all records\n            in each <code>PutRecords</code> request. A single record failure does not stop the\n            processing of subsequent records.</p>\n        <p>A successfully processed record includes <code>ShardId</code> and\n                <code>SequenceNumber</code> values. The <code>ShardId</code> parameter identifies\n            the shard in the stream where the record is stored. The <code>SequenceNumber</code>\n            parameter is an identifier assigned to the put record, unique to all records in the\n            stream.</p>\n        <p>An unsuccessfully processed record includes <code>ErrorCode</code> and\n                <code>ErrorMessage</code> values. <code>ErrorCode</code> reflects the type of error\n            and can be one of the following values:\n                <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code> or <code>InternalFailure</code>.\n                <code>ErrorMessage</code> provides more detailed information about the\n                <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code> exception including the account\n            ID, stream name, and shard ID of the record that was throttled.

A shard iterator expires 5 minutes after it\n            is returned to the requester.</p>\n        <p>A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start reading data records sequentially. The position is specified using the sequence number of a data record in a shard. A sequence number is the identifier associated with every record ingested in the stream, and is assigned when a record is put into the stream. Each stream has one or more shards.</p>\n        <p>You must specify the shard iterator type. For example, you can set the\n            <code>ShardIteratorType</code> parameter to read exactly from the position denoted\n            by a specific sequence number by using the <code>AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER</code> shard\n            iterator type. Alternatively, the parameter can read right after the sequence number by\n            using the <code>AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER</code> shard iterator type, using sequence numbers\n            returned by earlier calls to <a>PutRecord</a>, <a>PutRecords</a>,\n            <a>GetRecords</a>, or <a>DescribeStream</a>. In the request,\n            you can specify the shard iterator type <code>AT_TIMESTAMP</code> to read records from\n            an arbitrary point in time, <code>TRIM_HORIZON</code> to cause\n            <code>ShardIterator</code> to point to the last untrimmed record in the shard in the\n            system (the oldest data record in the shard), or <code>LATEST</code> so that you always\n            read the most recent data in the shard. </p>\n        <p>When you read repeatedly from a stream, use a <a>GetShardIterator</a> request to get the\n            first shard iterator for use in your first <a>GetRecords</a> request and for subsequent\n            reads use the shard iterator returned by the <a>GetRecords</a> request in\n            <code>NextShardIterator</code>. A new shard iterator is returned by every\n            <a>GetRecords</a> request in <code>NextShardIterator</code>, which you use in the\n            <code>ShardIterator</code> parameter of the next <a>GetRecords</a> request. </p>\n        <p>If a <a>GetShardIterator</a> request is made too often, you receive a\n            <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. For more information about\n            throughput limits, see <a>GetRecords</a>, and <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html\">Streams Limits</a> in the\n            <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>.</p>\n        <p>If the shard is closed, <a>GetShardIterator</a> returns a valid iterator\n            for the last sequence number of the shard.

The shard\n            iterator specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading data\n            records sequentially. If there are no records available in the portion of the shard that\n            the iterator points to, <a>GetRecords</a> returns an empty list. It might\n            take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains records.</p>\n        <p>You can scale by provisioning multiple shards per stream while considering service\n            limits (for more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html\">Amazon Kinesis Data Streams\n                Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer\n                    Guide</i>). Your application should have one thread per shard, each reading\n            continuously from its stream. To read from a stream continually, call <a>GetRecords</a> in a loop. Use <a>GetShardIterator</a> to get the\n            shard iterator to specify in the first <a>GetRecords</a> call. <a>GetRecords</a> returns a new shard iterator in\n            <code>NextShardIterator</code>. Specify the shard iterator returned in\n            <code>NextShardIterator</code> in subsequent calls to <a>GetRecords</a>.\n            If the shard has been closed, the shard iterator can't return more data and <a>GetRecords</a> returns <code>null</code> in <code>NextShardIterator</code>.\n            You can terminate the loop when the shard is closed, or when the shard iterator reaches\n            the record with the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the last record\n            to process.</p>\n        <p>Each data record can be up to 1 MiB in size, and each shard can read up to 2 MiB\n            per second. You can ensure that your calls don't exceed the maximum supported size or\n            throughput by using the <code>Limit</code> parameter to specify the maximum number of\n            records that <a>GetRecords</a> can return. Consider your average record size\n            when determining this limit. The maximum number of records that can be returned per call\n            is 10,000.</p>\n        \n        <p>The size of the data returned by <a>GetRecords</a> varies depending on\n            the utilization of the shard. The maximum size of data that <a>GetRecords</a>\n            can return is 10 MiB. If a call returns this amount of data, subsequent calls made\n            within the next 5 seconds throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. If\n            there is insufficient provisioned throughput on the stream, subsequent calls made within\n            the next 1 second throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. <a>GetRecords</a> doesn't return any data when it throws an exception. For this\n            reason, we recommend that you wait 1 second between calls to <a>GetRecords</a>. However, it's possible that the application will get exceptions for longer than 1\n            second.</p>\n        <p>To detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you can use the\n            <code>MillisBehindLatest</code> response attribute. You can also monitor the stream\n            using CloudWatch metrics and other mechanisms (see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/monitoring.html\">Monitoring</a> in the <i>Amazon\n                    Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>).</p>\n        <p>Each Amazon Kinesis record includes a value,\n            <code>ApproximateArrivalTimestamp</code>, that is set when a stream successfully\n            receives and stores a record. This is commonly referred to as a server-side time stamp,\n            whereas a client-side time stamp is set when a data producer creates or sends the record\n            to a stream (a data producer is any data source putting data records into a stream, for\n            example with <a>PutRecords</a>). The time stamp has millisecond precision.\n            There are no guarantees about the time stamp accuracy, or that the time stamp is always\n            increasing. For example, records in a shard or across a stream might have time stamps\n            that are out of order.</p>\n        <p>This operation has a limit of five transactions per second per account.</p>\n        \n      "

After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the\n            status of the stream back to <code>ACTIVE</code>. Depending on the size of the stream,\n            the scaling action could take a few minutes to complete.
